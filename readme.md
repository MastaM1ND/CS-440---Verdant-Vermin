While table-setup shows the sql queries to replicate the backend, the application will run via a cloud hosted backend so long as you are using an IPv6 Wifi/internet connection

Open two terminals at the top of the project folder

cd one into backend and the other into frontend

in backend, run "node index.js"

in frontend, run "npm start"

Finally, open http://localhost:3000 on your web browser to use the application
